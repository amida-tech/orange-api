# Group Habits
## Patient Habits [/patients/{patientid}/habits]
Habits are real-life *preferences* of the patient: what time they usually wake up
in the morning, what time they usually eat lunch, and so on. Exactly one set of
preferences is stored for each patient. The current user will need read access
to the patient to view the habits, and write access to set them.

Habits must be in the specific `HH:MM a` format; for example, `03:59 am` and `11:20 pm`.
These times are in the *local timezone* of the patient, and will not change if the 
timezone is updated (for example, if `breakfast` is set to `10:00 am` while the timezone
is `London/Europe`, `breakfast` will remain as `10:00 am` if the timezone is updated to
`America/New_York`. This signifies that if medication is to be taken with food at
breakfast every morning, the patient should continue doing that even if the timezone shifts).

Habits (all may be blank, and initially are after registration):
+ `wake` (*time*) - what time the patient normally wakes up in the morning. Defaults to `07:00 am`.
+ `sleep` (*time*) - what time the patient normally goes to sleep at night. Defaults to `08:00 am`.
+ `breakfast` (*time*) - what time the patient normally eats breakfast. Defaults to `12:00 pm`.
+ `lunch` (*time*) - what time the patient normally eats lunch. Defaults to `07:00 pm`.
+ `dinner` (*time*) - what time the patient normally eats dinner. Defaults to `11:00 pm`.
+ `tz` (*timezone*) - the current timezone of the patient (retrieved automatically
    from the mobile OS without any user participation required). Should be a valid TZ
    database timezone (e.g., `/London/Europe`). Defaults to `Etc/UTC` (UTC time).
